# Releasing Updates

## Iterations

As part of the beta process, the team will be publishing updates as frequently
as necessary. As things stabilize and we get feedback about the beta we'll
update this process.

## The Process

1. Ensure the release notes for `RELEASE_VERSION` in [`changelog.json`](../changelog.json) are up-to-date.
1. Bump `version` in [`app/package.json`](../app/package.json) to `RELEASE_VERSION`.
1. Commit & push the changes.
1. Checkout a new branch `__release-NAME-OF-THE-RELEASE` and push it
