# First Responder Rotation

We have a first responder rotation. The goals of the rotation are:

1. Ensure community issues and PRs are answered in a timely manner.
1. Ensure support load is shared across the whole team.
1. Free up the rest of the team to focus on milestone work.
1. Give everyone a regular break from milestone work.

Each rotation is a week long. While first responder your primary duties are:

1. Triage issues.
  * Troubleshoot or follow up on troubleshooting started by the previous first responder.
  * Review the [more-information-needed](https://github.com/kactus-io/kactus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Amore-information-needed+sort%3Aupdated-asc) and [needs-reproduction](https://github.com/kactus-io/kactus/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+sort%3Aupdated-asc+label%3Aneeds-reproduction) issues and close any that have gone 2 weeks with no new activity.
1. Review community pull requests.

Once those things are done, you should feel free to spend your time scratching your own itches on the project. Really wanna refactor that one monstrous component? Go for it! Wanna fix that one bug that drives you nuts? Do it! Wanna upgrade all of our dependencies? You're an awesome masochist!

That said, tasks which need design work generally *aren't* well-suited to this. It would pull our fantastic designers away from milestone work and it would be hard to get done in a week's time.

If you're at a loss for ideas or wonder if something is an appropriate first responder task, ask the rest of the team! Or poke through the [`tech-debt`](https://github.com/desktop/desktop/labels/tech-debt) label for some inspiration.
