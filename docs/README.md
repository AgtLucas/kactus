## Technical

These documents contain more details about the internals of Kactus
and how things work:

 - **[Dialogs](technical/dialogs.md)** - details about the dialog component API
 - **[Windows menu bar](technical/windows-menu-bar.md)** - Electron doesn't
    provide inbuilt support for styling the menu for Windows, so we've created
    our own custom components to achieve this.
 - **[Developer OAuth App](technical/oauth.md)** - Kactus ships with
    the ability to OAuth on behalf of a user. A developer OAuth app is bundled
    to reduce the friction of getting started.
